# ZECMaker

This is a client-server app, a kind of game - the application mines a crypto currency (Zec in this case). You can see the graph that shows
your progress, and you can also see your wallet. The app connects with a site by API (by json file) to show the rates
of your currency and how it correspondes to the basic currencies (USD, EUR, etc). The AdMob is also used in the app.

## Installing / Getting started

Download it in your device and press "Go". Or use a promocode if you have one. Then press "Begin mining".
